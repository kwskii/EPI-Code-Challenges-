# EPI Code Challenges

## Introduction

This is my fork of EPI Judge Repo from the ELements of Programming Authors.
Within this repo you'll find my solutions for the problems given inside the book with hopefully different execution runtimes.
Every folder inside of the cpp folder will have a readme page with a gif of the program executing.

EPI Judge consists of the following:

- **Stub programs** for each problem in our book in Python, Java, and C++. *I'm going for cpp*
- **Test-cases** that cover common corner-case and performance bugs
- A **framework** for running these tests on your implementation on your machine


## Acknowledgments

Thank you to EPI authors from where I'm starting this repo and will take advantage of their framework for testing 

A big shout-out to the hundreds of users who tried out the release over the past couple of months. As always, we never fail to be impressed by the enthusiasm and commitment our readers have; it has served to bring out the best in us.
We all thank [Viacheslav Kroilov](https://github.com/metopa), for applying his exceptional software engineering skills to make EPI Judge a reality.
